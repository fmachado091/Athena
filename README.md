# Athena

This is a sort of online judge application developed as an academic project for the 2015 Software Engineering course, which is part of the Computer Engineering undergraduate course at ITA - Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica.

In our application, teachers are able to setup course groups and send programming exercises to them, along with secret test files (inputs and their respective outputs). Students can subscribe to those groups, send C/C++ or Java solutions for the exercises, and have them compiled and graded according to the comparison of their outputs with the ones provided by the teacher.

The Athena project was later improved by the 2016 class and can be found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AthenaCES29/Athena).
